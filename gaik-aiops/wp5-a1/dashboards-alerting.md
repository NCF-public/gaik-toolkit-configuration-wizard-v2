# Dashboard and alerting platform

Grafana for dashboards, Prometheus rules plus Alertmanager for alerting. Everything is provisioned from
files in `deploy/compose/`, so a fresh deployment comes up with the same datasources, dashboards and
alerts and nothing is configured by hand.

| Component | Local address | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Grafana | http://127.0.0.1:3000 (login required) | `grafana/provisioning/`, `grafana/dashboards/` |
| Prometheus | http://127.0.0.1:9090 | `prometheus/prometheus.yml`, `prometheus/rules/` |
| Alertmanager | http://127.0.0.1:9093 | `alertmanager/alertmanager.yml` |

## Dashboards

| Folder | Dashboard | Source | Shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monitoring | Service health | Prometheus | Requests per second, failed request share, p50/p95 latency, error logs, log volume by event class, active alerts, collector throughput and delivery failures. Filter by service. |
| Monitoring | Wizard operations | Prometheus | Solution Wizard API: live agents and sandbox runs against their limits, refusals by code, turn outcomes and length, agent failures by kind, sandbox runs by phase, sessions volume and database size, sessions overdue for removal, deletions, requests for other users' sessions, busiest owners, active alerts. |
| Monitoring | Hackathon live | Prometheus | Event view: active sessions, capacity, refusals, first-reply time, progress (sessions started, requirements and solution approved, successful PoC runs, PoC approved, documented), components in approved solutions. Cost panel waits for the cost metric. |
| Security (own organisation) | Audit trail | Postgres (read-only role) | Denied and failed events over time, events by name and outcome, latest events with pseudonymised actor and masked address. |

Dashboards are read-only in the UI (`allowUiUpdates: false`); changes go through the JSON files.
Evaluation and configuration comparison views are not part of this platform's content; they are added
by the WP5 instrumentation side on top of the same Grafana and datasources.

## Alerts

| Alert | Severity | Condition (placeholder thresholds) |
|---|---|---|
| HighErrorRatio | warning | More than 5 % of requests fail for 5 min |
| HighLatencyP95 | warning | p95 latency above 2 s for 10 min |
| ErrorLogs | info | A service keeps logging errors for 5 min |
| CollectorDown | critical | Collector not reachable (or never scraped) for 2 min |
| EventDeliveryBacklog | warning | Records queue up because storage does not accept them, for 2 min |
| EventDeliveryFailing | critical | Records dropped after retries ran out |

### Solution Wizard API

From the API's own `wizard_*` metrics (sent over OTLP when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set on
the api) and its request spans.

| Alert | Severity | Condition (default threshold) |
|---|---|---|
| WizardApiDown | critical | No metrics from the API for 5 min |
| WizardApiRestarted | warning | The process start time changed in the last 15 min |
| WizardApiMemoryHigh | warning | api container above 85 % of its memory limit for 5 min |
| WizardAgentsNearLimit | warning | Live agents above 80 % of `WIZARD_MAX_LIVE_AGENTS` for 2 min |
| WizardSandboxNearLimit | warning | Active runs above 80 % of `WIZARD_MAX_ACTIVE_RUNS` for 5 min |
| WizardCapacityRefusals | warning | Any request refused because agents, the chat rate or the sandbox were full (10 min) |
| WizardTurnStuck | warning | A chat turn running longer than 50 min; its session is locked |
| WizardTurnFailures | warning | More than 20 % of at least 5 chat turns failed in 15 min |
| WizardModelProviderErrors | warning | More than 3 agent failures from rate limits, overload, server errors or timeouts in 10 min |
| WizardSandboxFailures | warning | More than 50 % of at least 3 sandbox runs failed in 30 min |
| WizardSessionsVolumeFilling | warning | Sessions volume above 80 % for 10 min |
| WizardSessionsVolumeFull | critical | Sessions volume above 90 % for 5 min |
| WizardDatabaseLarge | warning | Wizard database above 4 GiB for 30 min |
| WizardSessionsOverdue | warning | Sessions past the retention period still there after an hour: the removal has not run |
| WizardSessionDeleteFailed | warning | A session deletion failed (any reason) |
| WizardOwnershipDenials | warning | More than 10 requests for other users' sessions in 10 min |
| WizardSessionBurst | warning | One owner id created more than 10 sessions in 10 min |
| WizardSessionCreateFailing | warning | Creating a session failed in the last 10 min |
| WizardSessionLimitHits | info | Uploads refused at the session or case size limit |
| WizardSessionDataMismatch | info | Session rows without a folder, or folders without a row, for an hour |
| WizardRunsUseSharedModelKey | info | Reminder while sandbox runs use the project's shared model key (no spending cap); clears when `WIZARD_POC_RUNNER_SECRET` names another Secret |

### Thresholds

Every adjustable threshold is a constant in `prometheus/rules/thresholds.yml`
(`gaik:threshold:<name>`); the alerts compare against those series. A deployment changes a value
there and reloads Prometheus; the rules themselves stay as they are. Durations (`for:`) and the
minimum volumes in the ratio alerts are in the rules, because they are part of what an alert means.

`CollectorDown` suppresses per-service warnings while it fires. Thresholds become real once the customer
sets service levels. Rule logic is unit-tested with promtool:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/deploy/compose/prometheus:/p" -w /p --entrypoint promtool \
  prom/prometheus:v3.2.1 test rules tests/collection-alerts.test.yml tests/wizard-alerts.test.yml
```

The backlog alert exists because the collector retries failed deliveries for up to five minutes before
it counts records as failed; for an audit trail, waiting for actual loss is too late. Verified with a live outage: with the sink
stopped, the alert reached Alertmanager after about 2.5 minutes, and all 31 audit events sent during the
outage were stored once the sink came back.

## Notification channels

Alerts are seen in Grafana: the "Active alerts" panels on the Service health, Wizard operations and
Hackathon live dashboards read Alertmanager. Alertmanager routes everything to a single `default`
receiver with no outside integration. That is the agreed channel for now; e-mail, chat or an
incident tool were not part of the delivered requirements and are a later addition, made in
`alertmanager.yml` only.

## Access control (link to WP4)

- Grafana requires login; anonymous access and sign-up are off. The local admin password is a placeholder.
- Grafana login through the WP4 identity provider (OIDC) with the WP4 role model: `identity.yml` overlay,
  see `wp4/grafana-oidc.md`. admin → Admin, other roles → Viewer, no role → refused.
- The audit datasource and dashboard are in a separate "Security" organisation that only the admin role
  joins (as Viewer). Folder permissions are not enough: in Grafana OSS any organisation member can query
  every datasource in that organisation through the API. The organisation is created by
  `grafana/setup/security_org.py`, because file provisioning cannot create organisations.
- The audit datasource uses the read-only `collection_reader` role.

## Logs

The collector receives logs only from applications that send them over OTLP. A shared cloud
project gives no way to collect pods' own output (that needs a node-level agent), so each service
sends its records itself: the Wizard API sends records at `WIZARD_OTEL_LOG_LEVEL` (WARNING unless
set) and above. They pass the collector's privacy step and feed the error-log panel and the
`ErrorLogs` alert. Where logs are stored for search is a separate choice (ADR draft).
