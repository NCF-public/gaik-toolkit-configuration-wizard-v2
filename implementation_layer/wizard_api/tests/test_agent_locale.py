"""The agent's reply language follows the UI locale (customer test report, T5; 11, 14, 17, R9).

The locale reached the agent only in the bootstrap turn, and the web route never
sent one at all, so the agent chose its own language — mixing Finnish and
English in the same session and once answering in Italian. These tests cover the
API half: the instruction that pins the language, and the one that re-pins it
when the user switches the UI mid-session.
