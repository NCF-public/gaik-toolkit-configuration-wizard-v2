"""OpenTelemetry spans for the WP5 AIOps stack.

The API sends its spans over OTLP/HTTP to the collector named by the standard
``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` or ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT``
(locally ``http://127.0.0.1:4318``) and nowhere else. Spans carry numbers,
statuses and the session id only: never what the user or the agent wrote, and
never who the user is (no e-mail address, no ``enduser.id``).

Without an endpoint ``setup()`` installs nothing and every span is a no-op, so
tests and deployments that have not been pointed at a collector behave as before.

The ``gaik.*`` attribute names are a draft until the WP5 event schema v1.
