"""Bring the agent's on-disk artifacts into the session the UI reads (#141).

The wizard agent writes its artifacts into the session's ``output_dir`` —
``use_case.blueprint.json`` at spec generation, ``workflow.bpmn`` and the rest
later. The UI, meanwhile, reads the blueprint from the database
(``blueprint_versions``) and the BPMN is generated on demand from that same V2
blueprint. Nothing carried the former into the latter: the only code that
touched the generated files checked that ``use_case.blueprint.json`` *existed*
so the step could advance, and never read it. So the workspace kept showing the
seed blueprint however far the conversation had progressed — the demo-parity
gap in #141.

This module is that bridge, and it is the single place that knows the artifact
filenames and the V1 → V2 blueprint mapping.

Everything here is best-effort: a missing, half-written or malformed artifact
returns ``None`` rather than raising, because the agent writes these files
while the user is mid-conversation and a chat turn must never fail on one.
