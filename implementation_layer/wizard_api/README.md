# Wizard API (S1-1 + S1-3 + S1-2 + S1-12)

FastAPI service for Solution Wizard V2 session persistence.

**Issues:** #5 S1-1 · #7 S1-3 · #6 S1-2 · #8 S1-12 · #9 S1-5 · #10 UI wire · #11 tests

## Quick start — Docker Compose (Sprint 1 demo)

```bash
cd implementation_layer/wizard_api
export NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=dev-compose-encryption-key-32chars!!
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| UI | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://localhost:8100/health |
| Postgres | localhost:5432 (`wizard` / `wizard`) |

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTH=true` in the UI container for dev login (`dev@gaik.local`).

## Local API only (without Docker UI)

```bash
cd implementation_layer/wizard_api
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres   # or use existing Postgres
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn wizard_api.main:app --reload --port 8100
```

Wire the UI:

```bash
# solution_wizard_v2/.env.local
WIZARD_API_URL=http://localhost:8100
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTH=true
```

## Session API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/sessions` | Create (`user_id`, optional `title`, `metadata`) — seeds blueprint v1 |
| `GET` | `/sessions?user_id=` | List sessions |
| `GET` | `/sessions/{id}` | Full session detail (blueprint, versions, messages) |
| `PATCH` | `/sessions/{id}` | Update `step`, `gate_statuses`, `metadata` |
| `POST` | `/sessions/{id}/messages` | Append chat messages (Sprint 1 stub) |
| `POST` | `/sessions/{id}/versions` | New blueprint version |

Steps are **1–13** (matches V2 UI phase stepper). Gate keys: `gate_1` … `gate_4`.

### Errors

Every error answers in one shape (`wizard_api/errors.py`):

```json
{"detail": {"error": "sandbox_busy", "message": "the sandbox is busy: 3 runs are going; try again in a minute", "trace_id": "…"}}
```

`error` is a stable code the web branches on (`gate_not_ready`, `sandbox_busy`,
`poc_package_incomplete`, …), `message` is a short line for the person, and any
extra keys (`gate`, `missing`, `problems`) are what they need to act. `trace_id`
is the caller's `x-trace-id` (or a fresh one), echoed as a response header. A
failure's cause (an exception's text, a path, a traceback, a Kubernetes message)
is logged under that trace id and never put in the answer. SSE streams report an
error as `{"error": true, "code": "...", "message": "...", "trace_id": "..."}`.
The web relays pass on only the codes listed in `solution_wizard_v2/lib/safe-error.ts`;
anything else becomes a generic message carrying the trace id.

## Service authentication (#132)

Every endpoint except `/health` requires the shared secret
`WIZARD_API_TOKEN`, presented as an `X-Wizard-Service-Token` header. The web
app's server-side proxy is the only legitimate caller and sends it
automatically.

| `WIZARD_API_TOKEN` | Behaviour |
|--------------------|-----------|
| unset / whitespace | Auth **off**. Any caller is accepted. Startup logs a warning. Intended for local dev and the docker stack. |
| set | Requests without a matching header get `401`. `/health` stays open for liveness/readiness probes. |

Set it to the **same value** on both the web and the api pod:

```bash
oc set env deploy/wizard-v2-api WIZARD_API_TOKEN=<secret> -n gaik
oc set env deploy/wizard-v2-web WIZARD_API_TOKEN=<secret> -n gaik
```

**This is inert until that env var exists.** Shipping the code alone changes
nothing — an unset token means the API stays open exactly as before.

What this does *not* do: `user_id` is still self-asserted, so a caller holding
the token can act as any user. Real per-user authentication is #134.

### The wizard agent never sees the API's secrets

The chat endpoint spawns the V1 wizard agent (Claude Agent SDK) from this
process, and the SDK merges its `env` option *over* the inherited environment
rather than replacing it. The agent has a Bash tool, so anything left in the
environment is one `env` away from a prompt injection — and with the service
token the agent could call this API as any user. `config.py` therefore reads
`WIZARD_API_TOKEN` and `WIZARD_DATABASE_URL` once, at import, and removes them
from the process environment; the agent, its Bash tool and the V1 scripts it
runs never inherit them. Provider variables the scripts need (Foundry, Azure,
OpenAI) are left untouched.

This is defence in depth, not isolation: a same-UID process can still read the
initial environment through `/proc/<pid>/environ`. Real isolation means running
the agent in its own pod, or restricting its Bash tool.
## Who a call acts for (#134)

Every call the web app makes carries `X-Wizard-User-Id`, the signed-in user.
A `/sessions/{id}/...` route is served only when that session belongs to the
named user; another user's session answers `404`, the same as a session that
does not exist. `GET /sessions?user_id=` and `POST /sessions` must name the
same user as the header (`403` otherwise). This is a router-level dependency
(`wizard_api/ownership.py`), so a route added later is covered without
remembering anything.

| `WIZARD_REQUIRE_USER_HEADER` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| unset | A call **without** the header is served (the sandbox Job's init container and the stack E2E helpers still call with the token alone). Ownership is enforced whenever the header is present. |
| `1` | A call without the header gets `400`. Set it once every caller sends the header (#203 / B3). |

`output_dir` is no longer accepted on `POST /sessions`; the server derives it.
`PATCH /sessions/{id}` refuses the metadata keys the server records itself
(`messages`, `refinements`, `last_successful_run`) with `422
server_owned_metadata`, so a successful run cannot be forged into existence.

## Case limits

A case holds at most 20 input files and 200 MB. A session's cases share one
volume with every other session, so the session is bounded as a whole too:

| Variable | Default | Bounds |
|---|---|---|
| `WIZARD_MAX_CASES_PER_SESSION` | `100` | cases a session may open |
| `WIZARD_MAX_SESSION_INPUT_MB` | `1024` | input of all the session's cases together |

Size them to the sessions volume (5 GiB on Rahti). Both are checked under a
session-wide lock, so requests at the same time cannot pass them together.

## Agent and chat limits

Each live chat session holds a wizard agent (a CLI process) in the API pod, and
every chat message is a billed model call. Limits on them:

| Variable | Default | Bounds |
|---|---|---|
| `WIZARD_MAX_LIVE_AGENTS` | `20` | agent processes in this API process |
| `WIZARD_MAX_LIVE_AGENTS_PER_USER` | `2` | agent processes one user may hold |
| `WIZARD_MAX_CHAT_TURNS_PER_MINUTE` | `0` (off) | chat messages one user may send in a sliding minute |
| `WIZARD_MAX_CHAT_MESSAGE_CHARS` | `20000` | characters in one chat message |
| `WIZARD_AGENT_MAX_TURNS` | `100` | model calls the agent may make for one message |

A user is the session's owner (the user named in `X-Wizard-User-Id`).

- **At the global cap** the longest idle agent of any user is ended (it resumes
  from its transcript later). When every agent is mid-turn or was just handed to
  a request, `POST /sessions/{id}/chat` answers `503`.
- **At their own cap** a user's own longest idle agent is ended to make room for
  their new one. When all of their agents are mid-turn, just used or still
  starting, the chat answers `429` with `{"error": "agent_busy", "message": ...}`
  and `Retry-After: 30`. Another user's agent is never ended for them, so a
  second user still gets a slot while the first is at their cap.
- **Over the chat turn rate** the chat answers `429` with
  `{"error": "chat_rate_limited", "message": ...}` and a `Retry-After` of the
  seconds until the oldest counted message leaves the minute. It is checked
  before an agent is woken, and only accepted turns are counted (a `409` while
  the agent is still replying does not use one up).

The counts live in the API process, as the agents do; with more than one API
replica each counts its own. The sandbox's run limits (`WIZARD_MAX_ACTIVE_RUNS`,
`WIZARD_MAX_ACTIVE_RUNS_PER_USER`, `429 sandbox_busy`) follow the same pattern.

## Output directory (S1-5)

On create, the API sets and creates:

`$WIZARD_SESSION_OUTPUT_ROOT/<user_id>/<session_id>/`

## Tests

```bash
# Postgres required (docker compose up -d postgres)
pytest

# Full stack in Docker (API + UI + E2E)
./scripts/docker-test.sh
```

Persistence tests skip automatically if Postgres is unavailable.  
`test_persistence_restart.py` simulates a new API process (fresh app instance, same Postgres) per #11 / US-S1-01.

### Upgrading the agent SDK

`claude-agent-sdk` is pinned to one exact version in `pyproject.toml`, and with
it the Claude Code CLI the SDK bundles (the image installs no separate CLI).
The agent runs with `bypassPermissions`; the only thing limiting its tools,
files and commands is the PreToolUse hook in
`wizard_api/services/agent_tool_guard.py`. An SDK or CLI release that changes
how hooks are registered, what a hook call carries or what a hook must return
could turn that guard off without an error.

So an SDK upgrade is a change of the pin plus a green
`tests/test_agent_sdk_contract.py`, which runs in the wizard-api CI job without
any model API key. It checks that:

- the installed SDK is the pinned version;
- the options `agent_service._build_options` builds register the guard for
  every tool call (`PreToolUse`, no matcher) under `bypassPermissions`;
- the SDK's hook types (`HookEvent`, `PreToolUseHookInput`,
  `PreToolUseHookSpecificOutput`, `HookCallback`, `SDKHookCallbackRequest`)
  still have the fields the guard reads and answers with;
- driven through the SDK's own control protocol by a fake CLI, with hook inputs
  built from those types, the guard refuses a disallowed tool, a path outside
  the session and a shell operator, and lets an allowed call through.

To upgrade: change the pin, reinstall, run the test, and read the SDK's
changelog for hook changes the test cannot see (for example a new hook event
that runs tools). Do not loosen the test to make a new version pass; fix the
guard or its wiring first.

```bash
uv run --with-editable ../solution_wizard pytest -q tests/test_agent_sdk_contract.py
```

## Model

- `wizard_sessions` — step, gates, metadata (title, messages, status), `active_version`, `output_dir`
- `blueprint_versions` — versioned blueprint JSON per session

## Deleting a session

A user deletes their own session from the session list. An operator does it for them from the api pod:

```bash
python -m wizard_api.session_admin list <user id>
python -m wizard_api.session_admin delete <session id> --reason data-subject-request
python -m wizard_api.session_admin protect <session id>        # kept until --off
python -m wizard_api.session_admin export <user id> --out <folder>
```

`--reason` is one of `data-subject-request`, `owner-left` or `other`, and it goes to the log with the session id. Deleting removes the database row and blueprint versions, the session folder, the session's sandbox Jobs and the agent's conversation files. It does not reach backups or logs already written. A session in mid-turn or a protected session is refused.

`export` writes one zip per session, the same one the session list's Export link gives: `session.json` with the conversation, gates and blueprint versions, and `files/` with the session folder. The agent's own working files, `.env` files and caches are left out. Take the zips off the pod and delete them there when the request is answered.
