/**
 * What the PoC tab knows about the generated package.
 *
 * wizard_api's `GET /sessions/{id}/poc/files` answers `generated` (files
 * exist) and, since the package check, `ready` plus `problems` (the files add
 * up to a package worth handing over). The tab used to read only `generated`,
 * so a package the API itself called not ready — an unwired run_poc.py, no gaik
 * in the requirements — was shown as "Generated PoC package" with a download
 * button and an enabled sandbox run.
 *
 * An answer without `ready` (the mock store, an older api) does not say the
 * package is bad, so it counts as ready: only an explicit `ready: false`
 * withholds the download and the run.
