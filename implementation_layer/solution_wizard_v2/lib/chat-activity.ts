/**
 * The chat's progress line while the agent works.
 *
 * wizard_api sends `{"activity": {"kind", "file"}}` when the agent starts a
 * tool: writing or reading a file, running a check, searching. Long steps
 * (schema generation, writing the package) used to show only the typing dots
 * for minutes. The kind and a file's base name come from the server; the
 * words are chosen here, in the user's language.
 *
 * That frame is all the stream tells about a step: one arrives as a tool
 * starts, none when it ends, and a check that is run says nothing about what
 * it checks. So a step counts as finished when the next one starts, and
 * several of the same in a row are one line with their number.
