 * Whether the PoC tab starts a test run by itself now.

 * The run was a button: the package was ready and checked, the test material
 * was there, and the session still waited for someone to press "Run the test"
 * before there was anything to look at. Users asked why that step was theirs.
 * The run now starts when everything it needs is in place, and again when the
 * wizard has changed the package, so the user's part is to judge the result.
 * "Run again" stays, for a run on the user's own material.
 *
 * A run is started once per package version. A session opened with a run
 * already behind it takes that run as its package's ("adopt"): the page cannot
 * tell which version the run tested, and starting another on every reload
 * would spend the shared sandbox for nothing.
