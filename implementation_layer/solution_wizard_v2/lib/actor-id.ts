// A stable pseudonym for the signed-in user in logs and audit events.
//
// The log line used to carry the e-mail address itself. An operator still
// needs to tell one person's actions apart from another's (and from the same
// person across requests), but the address has no business sitting in the
// log stream, where it is kept and forwarded far longer than the session.
// So the e-mail is folded into `u_` + the first 16 hex chars of an HMAC-SHA256
// over the lowercased, trimmed address: the same person always gets the same
// id, and the id alone does not give the address back.
//
// Key, in order of preference: WIZARD_PSEUDONYM_KEY, or the Server Actions
// key that every deployment already has (with a label in the HMAC input so
// the pseudonym is not a signature made with that key). Without either, a
// plain SHA-256 keeps the id stable but guessable for anyone who knows an
// address, and the first use says so once.
//
// node:crypto only: this runs in route handlers and Server Actions, not in
// the Edge middleware.
